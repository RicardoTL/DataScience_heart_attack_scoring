Hello! 

What do you need to know? ðŸ“¢

This repository has an academic character, the objective is to show the development of a Regression Supervised Machine Learning model.

The data are fictitious and are obtained from the dataset that you can find here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rashikrahmanpritom/heart-attack-analysis-prediction-dataset

How is the repository organized? ðŸ“¢

- Data: It contains the original and modified datasets.
- Models: Contains two pipelines with the final execution and retraining model.
- Results: Contains the final variables.
- App_heart: Contains everything related to the development of the application indicated in the header of the Heart_Atack.ipynb notebook.
- Heart_Atack.ipynb: Notebook with the complete development of the machine learning model.

Thanks for reading me!
